# Gesture-recognition-contd-using_a_fully_connected_neural_network
Contd. from the gesture recognition using naive bayes repository, I have trained a fully connected network on the same data and I have been abel get 77% accuracy, compared to the earlier 60 % of naive Bayes

Please read the wiki !!

1) All png files are the figures
2) keras_tfmodel_200epoch (is the pre-trained model)
